Front end contract maker paired to the <a href="https://github.com/kitfud/SmartSplitter">SmartSplitter Solidity Contract <a/>in my repo. 

Below is a view of the contract maker interface. You paste in the payee addresses separated by a comma and then you decide on the payout ratio per each. Allocating 1 share each would split payment equally between payees. Once you've created a SmartSplitter contract you'll see an update with the address in red. Copy and past this into the <a href="https://github.com/kitfud/SmartSplitter_FrontEnd_Wallet_Interface"> Smart Splitter Wallet interface <a/> to interact with the contract.
